        Assign models to different devices. In the scope of a single process.
        Assigner assumes all GPUs have the **same processing power**.

        Assignment is based on four aspects:

        1. Distance and model connections. Connection is usually indicated
           by the amount of data transmitted between two models.
        2. Compute complexity.
        3. Model size.
        4. Entropy.

        Four aspects are controlled by four weights:

        1. ``connection_weight``, assigner will try to reduce the total
           ``distance * connection`` if this weight is larger.
        2. ``size_match_weight``, this weight controls the total memory
           space used on a single device, only works if total assigned
           memory of models exceeds allowed device memory size
           (internally it uses a relu activation), the larger,
           the tighter and more restricted the fit.
        3. ``complexity_match_weight``, this weights balance the model
           computation cost across devices, assigner will try to even
           the ``computation cost / compute power`` ratio for each device
           if this weight is larger.
        4. ``entropy_weight``, this weight minimize the uncertainty of
           model placement probability, so ``model i`` will have a close to 1
           probability of locating on some ``device j`` if this weight is
           larger.

        Assignment uses gradient descent to compute the probability matrix
        of each ``model i`` locating on each available ``device j``.

        Note:
            When the sum of your model size is very close to the capacity of
            your device memory, `ModelAssigner` does not respond very well
            to the ``size_match_weight``, therefore, please consider about
            increasing ``model_size_multiplier`` or decreasing
            ``max_mem_ratio``.
